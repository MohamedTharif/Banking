# Java ATM Interface

The Java ATM Interface project is a program that simulates the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It provides an interactive user interface where users can perform various banking operations, such as checking balance, making withdrawals, deposits, and showing transaction history.

## Features

- **User-friendly interface:** The ATM interface offers a menu-driven approach, making it easy for users to select their desired operation.
- **Account management:** Users can check their account balance, make withdrawals and deposits.
- **Transaction management:** Users can transfer amounts from one user to another.
- **Transaction History:** Users can check all transactions of a particular account holder during one active session.
- **Error handling:** The program includes error handling mechanisms to handle incorrect inputs, insufficient funds, and invalid operations.
